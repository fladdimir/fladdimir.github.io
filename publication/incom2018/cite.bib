abstract = "Changeable material flow systems as well as the use of material flow simulation represent approaches to cope with the challenges of future logistics operations in times of growing complexity, frequently varying demands and shorter product lifecycles. Modular plug-and-play continuous conveying systems are a special type of changeable material flow systems suitable to meet the imposed requirements. This paper presents how simulation methods can be applied to support the development of modules for this kind of system. As an example, a simulation model for the virtual commissioning of modules for an “Industry 4.0 - Learning Factory” is described, which is currently developed at the Institute for Logistics and Material Handling Systems of the Otto-von-Guericke-University together with the partner institutions Fraunhofer IFF Magdeburg and TTI Riga, Latvia."
